# NMD core

`nmd-core` is the *core* of [NMD](https://github.com/nricciardi/nmd). It can be used to load and build NMD files or dossier.

If you want know more about NMD, please, you should open this [link](https://github.com/nricciardi/nmd).

To get start add `nmd-core` to your project:

```shell
cargo add nmd-core
```

## Documentation

[Full documentation](target/doc/nmd_core/index.html)


### Quick start

```rust
let dossier_path = PathBuf::from("...");

let codex = Codex::of_html();

let loader_configuration = LoadConfiguration::default();

let dossier = Dossier::load_dossier_from_path_buf(&dossier_path, &codex, &loader_configuration, LoadConfigurationOverLay::default()).unwrap();

let compiled_dossier = dossier.compile(...).unwrap();
```

### Tricky algorithms

There are two tricky algorithms in core:

- Load of `LoadBlock`
- Compilation of `CompilableText`


#### Load of LoadBlock

TODO

#### Compilation of CompilableText

`CompilableText` (CT) can be considered as the compilable text unit in NMD. It performs low level compilation of strings using text rules inserted in `Codex` 

CT is composed by an ordered list of *parts* where each part (`CompilableTextPart`) can be:

- **Fixed** if no rules can be applied on it
- **Mutable** if rules can act on it

In addiction, each part has a bucket (i.e. a set) of incompatible modifiers, i.e. modifiers which must not be applied on part.

Generally, CT can work starting from a random list of parts.

Suppose you have a NMD string (`String` or `&str`). It is loaded in CT through `from` method:

```rust
let nmd_string = "...";

let ct = CompilableText::from(nmd_string);
```

Internally, it is converted in a (single) mutable part:

```rust
impl From<&str> for CompilableText {
    fn from(value: &str) -> Self {
        Self::from(CompilableTextPart::new_compilable(
            value.to_string(),
            ModifiersBucket::None
        ))
    }
}
```

When you run compilation on CT, every text rules are applied **in order** (specified in `Codex`) **over whole parts list**.

We must notice that each rule can be applied only over the mutable parts of CT. **Mutable parts can be split to another by fixed parts** (this is tricky!).

First of all, string of mutable parts is created to perform regex search on it.

This string composed by mutable parts is called `compilable_content` and for each mutable part which composes it is saved the position in `compilable_content` where each mutable part ends.

Then, regex search is performed over `compilable_content`

There are 2 `while` loops. The outer loop iterates over parts indices (considering all parts, even fixed parts). This loop is used to elaborate every parts **considering the current match**.

The inner loop still iterates over paters indices (considering all parts, even fixed parts) and it is used to find parts which are related to current match.

We must notice that a regex match can start from the middle of a mutable part. In particular for each match can be happen:

1. Match is contained in a single mutable part
2. Match starts in the middle of a mutable part and terminates in the middle of another mutable parts, but **between these two mutable parts can be a set of fixed and other mutable parts**! 

In case 2, parts which "are split" by match are handled as following:

- If part is a mutable part and match start position is greater than part start, then the first part of mutable part is untouched, while the second part must be stored
- If part is a mutable part, match start is less than part start and match end is greater than part end, then the whole mutable part must be stored
- If part is a fixed part, it is stored
- If part is a mutable part and match end is greater than part end, then the first part is stored, the second is untouched

Stored parts are passed to **current** text rule to be processed. Rule returns list of parts, which are placed in replace of the stored part. 

When a match is fully handled, algorithm passes to next match and repeat until every parts are seen (for current rules).

When every text rules are tested algorithm ends.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Algorithm is "strange", it has 2 while, but it is $\approx O(n)$ because both loops iterate over the same parts vector.

### Known issues

- [x] Paragraphs and text are not parsed in tables
- [x] Nested text modifiers could be compiled wrongly (e.g. `*this is a **phrase** with some bold*.`)
- [x] List with empty lines between two items
- [ ] Missed `tab` as modifier
- [x] Missed style for simples quotes
- [x] Text between two list items
